The library data is downloaded from [here](ttp://tiny.cc/dcf/Library-small.rda).

# Basics

```{r}
load("Library-small.rda")
```
Let's inspect the length and the variables in the library data
```{r}
names(Inv)
nrow(Inv)

names(Bks)
nrow(Bks)
```

The `Inv` table contains the records of items in the library and the `Bks` table contains a list of books.


```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Current.Status) %>%
  tally()
```
The `Current.Status` column records the current status of the book,
and the `n` column counts the number of books in this status.


```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Issued.Count) %>%
  tally()
```

The `Issue.Count` column counts the number of times the book has been checked out,
and the `n` column counts the number of books in this case.
